== INSTALL ==

After having enabled this module, go to admin/config/media/image-toolkit,
select 'ImageAPI Optimize' as the default toolkit and Save, then adjust your
settings on the same page.

ImageAPI can use 3rd service like Yahoo! SmushIt, all that you needs is PHP 5.2+
with JSON support.

In order to have better performance, it is preferred to compile your selected
tools and give the paths to ImageAPI Optimize.

== NOTES ==
Everytime you install a new ImageAPI contrib module, go to the ImageAPI Optimize
settings page and save the configuration.
