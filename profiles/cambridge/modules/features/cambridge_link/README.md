Drupal 7 University of Cambridge link feature
=============================================

This feature provides a `field_link` base link field which can be reused across content types which have a 1-to-1 mapping between content and a URL, which creates a consistent name for templates to use.

The [Teasers](https://github.com/misd-service-development/drupal-feature-teasers) and [Carousel](https://github.com/misd-service-development/drupal-feature-carousel) features make use of these fields to link to the custom URL rather than to the node. For example, a carousel might contain a mixture of Basic Page content types and Link content types, providing a mixture of internal and external items to appear.
